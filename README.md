# Event-Management-System
Event management system is used to manage all the activity related to an event. In any event 
many service providers work simultaneously and it is very hard to manage these providers. It 
is also important for event organizer that he has all the contacts details of these service 
providers so that he can contact them any time to plan an event at given time. To manage all 
these activities we have developed this software. To get success in the event management 
business, user should have strong network contacts of service provider. These contacts are 
essentially providers of specific services who can be mobilized quickly to participate in any 
given event. In present system event company has to do all management work manually.
They keep all payment information on papers. There is no system to check the past expenses 
on any event. To do this they have to check payment register and this task is very time 
consuming and tiresome. Keeping all these problems in mind we have developed this system. 
This system helps the event management company to manage their paper work online and 
they can also retrieve report of last event they have completed.
